# Multi-faceted Exploration of Machine Learning Techniques
This repository contains the projects developed as part of the "Machine Learning" course (Jan '24 - Apr '24) under the guidance of Prof. Nipun Batra at IIT Gandhinagar. The projects encompass a wide range of machine-learning techniques applied to various image-processing tasks.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Decision Trees from Scratch
- **Objective**: Develop a deep understanding of decision trees by implementing them from the ground up.
- **Application**: Applied the constructed decision trees to classification tasks, enhancing comprehension of their fundamental principles and practical applications.

### 2. Image Super-Resolution with Linear Regression
- **Objective**: Enhance image quality by implementing image super-resolution techniques.
- **Method**: Utilized linear regression to improve the resolution of low-quality images.

### 3. Predicting Missing Image Patches
- **Objective**: Restore missing parts of images using predictive models.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - **Linear Regression with Random Fourier Features**: Enhanced prediction accuracy by mapping data to a higher-dimensional space.
  - **Alternating Least Squares**: Optimized the approximation of missing values in a collaborative filtering context.
  - **Matrix Factorization**: Employed to reconstruct missing image patches through low-rank approximations.

### 4. Image Data Compression using Matrix Factorization
- **Objective**: Optimize storage efficiency while maintaining image quality.
- **Method**: Explored matrix factorization techniques to compress image data, balancing between compression ratio and quality preservation.

### 5. MNIST Dataset Classification
- **Objective**: Train and evaluate machine learning models on the MNIST dataset.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: Implemented to perform classification tasks on handwritten digit images.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Applied as a simpler, yet effective, baseline for comparison.

### 6. VGG Models for Custom Image Dataset
- **Objective**: Classify images from a custom dataset comprising two distinct classes.
- **Method**: Curated a diverse dataset and evaluated the performance of various VGG models.
- **Outcome**: Conducted a comprehensive comparison among different VGG architectures to determine the most effective model for the classification task.

# Binary Classification Comparison of Different Models

This folder contains the implementation and comparison of various models for a binary classification task. The tasks performed include:

## Dataset Creation

Created a dataset consisting of 200 images, with 100 images for each class. Split the images into 80 for training and 20 for testing.

## Model Comparison Table

Generated a table summarizing the performance of each model, including VGG architectures with different depths, data augmentation, and transfer learning using VGG16 or VGG19 with different fine-tuning strategies.

## Tensorboard Visualization

Used Tensorboard to visualize the training and testing process of each model, including training loss, training accuracy, and testing accuracy plotted against iterations. Also, displayed images from the test set along with their predictions.

## Insights

Provided insights into various aspects of the experiment, including whether the results were as expected, the impact of data augmentation, the significance of the number of fine-tuning epochs, and any particular images that the models struggled with.

## Comparison with MLP

Created an MLP model with parameters comparable to VGG16 and compared its performance with the other models in the table. Provided conclusions based on the comparison.
